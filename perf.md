  1. Model Loading

   * Observation: Models are loaded synchronously when the TTSEngine is initialized. This can
     lead to a slow startup time, especially for the API server.
   * Suggestion: Implement lazy loading for the models. The models would only be loaded into
     memory when the first synthesis request is received. This would significantly improve the
     startup time of the API server and reduce memory consumption for applications that don't
     immediately perform synthesis.

  2. Text Processing and Chunking

   * Observation: The current text chunking logic is complex and involves multiple calculations
     and estimations. This can add overhead, especially for long texts.
   * Suggestion: Simplify the chunking logic. Instead of estimating durations, we can use a
     fixed character limit for each chunk. This would be faster and more predictable.
     Additionally, we can optimize the calculate_text_length function by pre-calculating the
     lengths of common punctuation marks.

  3. Transformer Model Iteration

   * Observation: The transformer model is executed in a loop (_run_transformer_steps), which
     can be a significant performance bottleneck.
   * Suggestion: Explore the possibility of fusing some of the operations within the
     transformer model. This would reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
     Additionally, we can investigate using a more efficient implementation of the transformer
     model, such as one based on ONNX Runtime with optimized providers.

  4. Caching

   * Observation: The sample_cache in TTSEngine is not fully utilized.
   * Suggestion: Implement a more comprehensive caching mechanism for synthesized audio. We can
     cache the output of the entire synthesis process, including the final wave. This would be
     particularly effective for frequently requested texts.

  5. Asynchronous Operations (API Server)

   * Observation: The API server (run_api_server.py) runs in a single-threaded mode with one
     worker. This can limit its ability to handle concurrent requests.
   * Suggestion: While the deterministic nature of the model requires a single worker for
     reproducibility, we can still improve concurrency by making the synthesis process itself
     asynchronous. By running the synthesize function in a separate thread or process, the API
     server can remain responsive to other requests while a long synthesis task is running.
